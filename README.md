Our first project is about Graduate Admissions from an Indian perspective
Prospective graduate students face a dilemma about which universities to apply for Master's programs.
Consultancies advising the students have proved unresourceful due to an over-reliance on past citerion.
We have obtained a kaggle dataset and will subsequently apply a series of classification and regression models to predict the likelihood of being 
admitted to any one university based on the series of student data available.


Of all the regression models , multiple linear regression gave as the highest accuracy score hence the one we would likely recommend
for solving this problem.
